 * Central dispatch from a game id to its in-game composable.
 *
 * This is the single integration point for playable games: [MainActivity] looks
 * up the id of the launched game here and, if present, renders the real game
 * (passing the chosen [GameDifficulty] and an `onExit` callback). Ids absent
 * from this map fall back to the generic stub screen.
 *
 * Each entry's composable lives in its own `view/games/<id>/` package, so games
 * can be added independently without touching one another's files.
